That is, instead of using the Armenian alphabet to write something like =E2=80=9C=D4=B2=D5=A1=D6=80=D5=A5=D6=82, =D5=AB=D5=B6=D5=B9=D5=BA=D5=A5=D5=BD =D5=A5=D6=84,=E2=80=9D instead, it is transliterated to =E2=80=9Cbarev/parev, inchbes ek.=E2=80=9D We believe that an Armenian Spell Checker is the solution to this issue. This project will aim to address the main issue that has led to this trend. If this problem is resolved, more people will begin to write in Armenian on their computers, thus creating a larger online Armenian presence. This will not only help give the Armenian online community a more serious look and feel, but it will also give the diaspora a chance to practice reading and writing in Armenian non-phonetically. We have a beautiful and unique alphabet, with a long and interesting history. It is not only a shame to not put it to use, but it could prove to be dangerous if the youth of the current generation, the first to have mainstream internet, doesn=E2=80=99t begin the practice of using it in an everyday setting, especially in the most used medium. The main goal of this project is to increase the ease of use of the Armenian alphabet in the digital realm. Particularly for users who tend to use latin letters to type Armenian or fall back to another language due to lack of spellcheck & autocorrect tools."],"p.9":{"br":{}},"p.10":{"strong":["Weekly and Monthly Responsibilities"]},"p.11":["Meet once a week for 1 hour on weekend"],"p.12":["Work 4-8 hours a week per person"],"p.13":{"br":{}},"p.14":{"strong":["Skills and Qualifications"]},"p.15":["NLP expert"],"ul":{"li":["Understanding of NLP techniques for text representation, semantic extraction techniques, data structures and modeling"],"li.1":["Knowledge of Python, Java and R"],"li.2":["Experience with machine learning frameworks (like Keras or PyTorch) and libraries (like scikit-learn)"]},"p.16":{"br":{}},"p.17":{"strong":["What You Get"]},"ul.1":{"li":["Opportunity to work on an impactful data science project related to Armenia"],"li.1":["Become part of dynamic and growing data science network"],"li.2":["Access DataPoint Armenia=E2=80=99s educational workshops"],"li.3":["Hone your data science skill set with hands on data projects utilizing real world data"],"li.4":["Work in small teams and get mentorship and training by project leads"]},"p.18":{"br":{}},"comment":{},"text.1":["        "]},"text.2":["      "],".attrs":["jobs-box__html-content jobs-description-content__text t-14 t-normal          jobs-description-content__text--stretch","job-details","-1","true"]},"comment":{},"text":["      "],"div.1":{"comment":{},"text":["      "],".attrs":["jobs-description__details"]},"text.1":["          "]}}
