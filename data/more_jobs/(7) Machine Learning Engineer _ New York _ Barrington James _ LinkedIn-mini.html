They have created a supercomputer that can process molecular dynamic solutions a lot faster than before.</p><p>New information on biomolecular development, such as protein folding, protein-drug interactions and dynamics has emerged as a result of their simulations. Overall the organisation places a lot of emphasis on computational techniques in biology, chemistry, and maths that are tightly coupled in a research setting.</p><p><strong><i>Essential skills</i></strong>:</p><ul><li>Experience in machine learning techniques development for biophysics, biochemistry, structural biology, drug discovery, cheminformatics, quantum chemistry, etc. <strong>(MUST HAVE)</strong></li><li>With an emphasis on deep learning methods (deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, deep reinforcement learning, deep belief nets, Boltzmann machines, graphs, transfer learning, etc.)</li><li>Open to considering candidates of all experience levels</li><li>Strong coding skills in Python in a must, additional coding experience is a plus.</li></ul><p><strong><i>Responsibilities:</i></strong></p><ul><li>Design, implement and evaluate cutting-edge generative models for protein design.</li><li>Effectively report and communicate research findings to AI and wet-lab teams across the company.</li><li>Develop sampling techniques for designing diverse proteins.</li><li>Collaborate with data scientists and wet-lab biologists on the design and integration of wet-lab experiments.</li><li>Deploy large-scale distributed training systems for cutting edge Molecular Dynamics hardware.</li></ul><p><strong><i>Benefits:</i></strong></p><ul><li>Above market average compensation</li><li>Enhanced bonus scheme</li><li>Long term incentives</li><li>Relocation package</li><li>25+ days holiday</li><li>Clear development pathway</li><li>Generous benefits package</li></ul><!---->        </span>      </div><!---->      <div class="jobs-description__details"><!---->      </div>    </div>  </article>    </div>
