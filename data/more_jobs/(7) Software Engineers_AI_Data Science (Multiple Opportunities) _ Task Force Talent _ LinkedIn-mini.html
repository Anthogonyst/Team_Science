This SINGLE application will place you into consideration for ALL software engineering roles available via Task Force Talent. At any one time, we are recruiting software engineers, AI, and Data Science for a dozen companies of all sizes.</p><p><br></p><p>This vacancy is for jobs in the Salt Lake City area (hybrid) or remote.</p><p><br></p><p>Examples:</p><p><br></p><p>-- Deep pockets, Google-X type incubator inside a very large, well known company working on tons of interesting things and spinning out multiple companies per year. This is your shot to try the startup game with zero risk of unemployment. FAANG level salaries or better!</p><p>-- Multiple AI related companies</p><p>-- Multiple cyber security companies</p><p>-- Other interesting firms ranging from quantum computing to RF imaging</p><p>-- Stealth mode startups</p><p><br></p><p>If we see an immediate fit, we will contact you directly. If not, but we think there is a good chance in the future, we will keep you under consideration for all future roles. No further action required!</p><p><br></p><p>PLEASE READ THE BELOW CAREFULLY TO AVOID AUTOMATIC REJECTION</p><p><br></p><p>***There is a LUCKY NUMBER at the end of this post. You MUST enter this number in the screening questions to avoid automatic rejection***</p><p><br></p><p>*NO internships at this time, sorry! You should be available for full time employment.</p><p><br></p><p>*If you are enrolled in an undergraduate program, please DO NOT apply more than 120 days before graduation. Companies are NOT hiring for 2023 at this time.</p><p><br></p><p>*You MUST be a U.S. citizen or have a valid U.S. work authorization. Jobs where we can sponsor visas will be posted separately. If you are a U.S. graduate student and already have a work authorization valid for 2-3 years, you are welcome to apply. If you do not have a valid U.S. work authorization, you will be automatically rejected.</p><p><br></p><p>*RECENT coding boot camp graduates WITHOUT a separate technical degree are rarely competitive for these roles and should NOT apply. You should have a few years of real world work experience.</p><p><br></p><p>*Recent college graduates should include information on projects they have built to be competitive.</p><p><br></p><p>WHY WE ARE DOING IT THIS WAY:</p><p><br></p><p>We've FREQUENTLY seen great people apply to the wrong job -- and once we've connected them with another position they didn't see, they've gotten hired!</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR:</p><p><br></p><p>-- 3-10+ years of real world software engineering, data science, or AI experience.</p><p>-- Experience with multiple languages, most often Python, Java, Javascript, C++ flavors, etc.</p><p>-- Experience with a major cloud provider and technologies such as K8s, Docker, etc.</p><p>-- Ideally full stack experience (front end, back end, databases); often people have their favorite (or least favorite) areas but you should be familiar with all these key components.</p><p>-- Good human being who can work on a team.</p><p>-- You've been doing this long enough that you've crashed and burned on a project and can talk about it. If you haven't failed before, you haven't tried to do hard things.</p><p><br></p><p>For the highest paying roles, you should be willing and able to pass a series of technical interviews based on medium to hard leetcode questions on data structures and algorithms. Each company has their own process; however, if you are comfortable with this, then you will ace the interview with any of our companies. If you are a good engineer with a track record, but not good at these type of questions, then let us know and we'll match you appropriately.</p><p><br></p><p>HOW WE MATCH YOU WITH ONE OR MORE OPPORTUNITIES:</p><p><br></p><p>-- Interests</p><p>-- Technical skills</p><p>-- Location preference + remote/hybrid</p><p>-- Salary preferences</p><p>-- Your timeline (it's FAR better to talk to us early!)</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes we set people up with 3+ interviews at a time; sometimes there's clearly a best fit, and sometimes we really like the person and don't have anything now but will actively search for something in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>Thank you for reading the entire description. The LUCKY NUMBER for this position is 76.</p><!---->        </span>      </div><!---->      <div class="jobs-description__details"><!---->      </div>    </div>  </article>    </div>
