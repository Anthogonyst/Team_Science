The primary focus of work will be centered around the further development of our flagship variant caller Lancet (https://github.com/nygenome/lancet), currently funded by NIH/NCI under the Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) program. Lancet leverages local assembly and joint analysis of tumor-normal paired sequencing data to improve the detection of somatic variants. You will be joining a team of experienced scientists, analysts, and programmers that are passionate about creating and using software systems to analyze human genetic variation. The team routinely develop, maintain, and improve analysis pipelines for variant discovery, pedigree analysis, phasing, imputation, and functional annotation.</p><p><br></p><p>Job duties will include, but are not limited to: </p><p><br></p><ul><li>Develop novel variant calling methods for challenging variant types and/or difficult regions of the genome;</li><li>Optimize code to enable robust and lightweight analysis of whole-genome sequencing data;</li><li>Compile documentation, user manuals, tutorials, vignettes and FAQs to allow facile adoption of tools by the broad research community;</li><li>Benchmark and evaluate bioinformatics tools usingappropriate QC measures.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Please note this job description is not designed to cover or contain a comprehensive listing of activities, duties or responsibilities that are required of the employee for this job.
