Software and computing infrastructure is a critical component in a pipeline that enables collection, management and analysis of very large volumes of data. SEMC supports a national user community and is a =E2=80=9Ccenter of centers=E2=80=9D including the following:</p><p><br></p><ol><li>The National Resource for Automated Molecular Microscopy (NRAMM) is a NIH Biotechnology resource that focuses on technology development for cryoEM and is driven by biological projects</li><li>The National Center for CryoEM Access and Training (NCCAT) is a NIH Common Fund center that provides access and training to the national academic community</li><li>The National Center for In-situ Tomographic Ultramicroscopy (NCITU) is a NIH Common Fund center to provides access and training for preparing in situ specimens for cryo electron tomography (cryoET)</li><li>The Simons Machine Learning Center is a new initiative that will focus on developing machine learning methods to accelerate protein structure determination.</li></ol><p><br></p><p>The SEMC computing group provides and supports the computing infrastructure essential to the collection and analysis of image data generated by 8 high-end electron microscopes and a range of supporting instruments. The group is responsible for overseeing and maintaining control software, data collection, data management, and the network of computers that enable the work of more than 1,000 users from the national community.</p><p><br></p><p>We are seeking a software developer to extend and maintain software applications that electron microscope users and operators utilize to manage data collection and computation. The candidate must have experience in developing applications in an environment that is largely based on Linux, MySQL, PHP, Python and Django, as well as familiarity with UI/UX concepts.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Maintaining and extending existing software applications</li><li>Collaborating with microscope operators on functionality and features</li><li>Working with system administrators to create front-end / back-end standards</li><li>Becoming familiar with Leginon, a system designed for automated collection of images from a transmission electron microscope</li><li>Rebuilding some applications to utilize new back-end system functionalities</li><li>Integrating with local infrastructure services consisting of OpenLDAP and MySQL</li><li>Maintaining source code in Git</li></ul><!---->        </span>      </div><!---->      <div class="jobs-description__details"><!---->      </div>    </div>  </article>    </div>
