To reach that goal, the company is developing a cancer prevention platform. </p><p><br></p><p><i>Position Summary</i></p><p>The Data Scientist will make an intellectual contribution to our methods and models by creating novel ways to understand, visualize and infer causal relationships across high-dimensional multi-omics data and clinically derived cancer data. The Data Scientist will build repeatable workflows to mature our analytical platform and aid in the design and development of architectural patterns to help grow our team. From ETLing new data, building novel machine learning algorithms, and generating client facing visualizations and reports, this candidate will optimize for impact and be at the forefront of advancing cancer-disrupting technologies. </p><p><br></p><p>The ideal candidate will be a self-starter who seeks opportunities to collaborate in a start-up environment and aid in the development of shared software design patterns. They will bring intellectual curiosity, a passion for reproducible research and analytics, and strong business execution skills. This is a unique opportunity to work side-by-side with industry experts and scientists in bioinformatics, cancer biology, and biochemistry to help us build an early stage cancer prevention platform.</p><p><br></p><p><i>What You'll Do </i></p><ol><li>Design and implement innovative algorithms to address challenges in data inference from noisy, big data from mass spectrometry data such as proteomics and metabolomics and clinical patient data.</li><li>Adoption and modification of existing machine learning and AI methods and creatively use multi-disciplinary tools to analyze multi-omics data.</li><li>Provide feedback and potential biomarker candidates to support drug discovery using in-house and publicly available datasets.</li><li>Create proprietary algorithms to identify cell drug targets. Present methods to internal and external stakeholders and make a case for advancing your discoveries from in-silico to in-vitro and in-vivo trials.</li><li>Visualization and interpretation of analysis results to provide client facing, data driven conclusions.</li><li>Execute and own the Machine Learning life cycle, generating repeatable workflows and developing shared standards for Data Science design patterns.</li></ol><p><br></p><p><i>Who You Are</i></p><ol><li>Strong skills in Python and experience in using machine learning and statistical analysis tools and libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, and PyTorch.</li><li>Demonstrated ability to apply and create novel ML solutions that advance insights in complex problem spaces, going beyond putting together existing code and libraries.</li><li>Demonstrated ability to write high-quality production ready code (well designed APIs, unit tests, documentation). Required proficiency in Python. Additional experience with Go, Scala, and/or Rust is a plus.</li><li>Experience with data engineering and warehousing tools. Experience with REST, GraphQL, standard SQL, and cloud optimized stores for both unstructured and structured data.</li><li>Experience with Docker and CI/CD workflows.</li><li>Experience with dashboarding and building high quality interactive data visualizations that go beyond basic plotting.</li><li>Experience in building scientifically driven and reproducible machine learning lifecycles. From problem scoping, building hypotheses, and iterative model refinement, you will balance technical trade offs to both drive business development and generate high-quality technical deliverables that will enable our team to grow.</li></ol><!---->        </span>      </div><!---->      <div class="jobs-description__details"><!---->      </div>    </div>  </article>    </div>
