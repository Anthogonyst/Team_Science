To reach that goal, the company is developing a cancer prevention platform. </p><p><br></p><p><i>Position Summary</i></p><p>Reporting to the Head of Bioinformatics, the Scientist will make an intellectual contribution to our development of a drug discovery pipeline that will be used for in-silico target identification and validation for different cancer types mainly based on the results of differential analysis of proteomics data, along with the scientific literature review and using public target, drug, and pathway databases. This is a unique opportunity to work side-by-side with industry experts and scientists in bioinformatics, cancer biology, and biochemistry to develop an early stage cancer prevention platform. </p><p><br></p><p>The ideal candidate will be a self-starter who seeks opportunities to collaborate in a start-up environment. She or he will bring experience doing data analysis, data extraction, and data quality assessment. </p><p><br></p><p><i>What You'll Do </i></p><ol><li>Design and implement innovative algorithms to address challenges in drug discovery, specifically based on analysis of proteomics data and PTMs</li><li>Adoption and modification of existing machine learning and AI methods and tools for analysis for target identification and validation</li><li>Data retrieval, transformation, and integration of public target and drug databases to support building an in-house drug discovery pipeline on big data</li><li>Investigate target engagement quantifiably and reliably and show the therapeutic role of target in the disease by developing algorithms and using data-driven methods</li><li>Design QC metrics for target assessment and orthogonal methods for target validation</li><li>Study potential drugs that can hit the target and evaluate the effectiveness of the drugs</li><li>Design new drugs for existing targets if repurposing is not available</li><li>Provide feedback to other teams to further improve existing pipelines and develop new workflows</li><li>Visualization and interpretation of analysis results to provide data driven conclusions</li></ol><p><br></p><p><i>Who You Are</i></p><ol><li>Experience in using machine learning, statistical analysis, and AI tools and libraries</li><li>Experience in building data analysis pipeline, problem definition, building hypothesis, and iterative model refinement</li><li>Experience structured and unstructured databases and data management tools</li><li>Experience using APIs to access and handle remote databases</li><li>Experience in drug discovery workflows, specifically therapeutic target identification, and preclinical validation</li><li>Experience in pathway analysis and networked-based methods in molecular biology</li><li>Familiarity with proteomics data specifically those acquired by mass spectrometry</li><li>Familiarity with Linux, shell, scripting languages, one popular programming language, preferably Python, C, or Java</li></ol><p><br></p><!---->        </span>      </div><!---->      <div class="jobs-description__details"><!---->      </div>    </div>  </article>    </div>
