The founding team has worked in entrenched industries where it=E2=80=99s nearly impossible to centralize large datasets due to sensitivity concerns, and our mission is to democratize decentralized data analytics to preserve privacy. We have engineered Devron=E2=80=99s cloud data platform so startups, SMBs, and large enterprises can now finally analyze sensitive consumer data while adhering to regulations, compliance, and privacy standards. Our vision: the very best user experience for an increasingly decentralized data world to tackle the challenges and opportunities of today where privacy is of utmost importance.</p><p><br></p><p>We have a clear vision: to develop a data platform backed with federated machine learning, that makes enterprise analytics affordable, seamless to use, and consistent to current data science experiences. This new innovative paradigm of decentralized machine learning focused on a cloud architecture combines the power of machine learning, modular pipelines, and data silos without worrying about redaction, anonymization, and duplication. We have deployed in several large and sensitive environments, enabling analysts and technologists to build decentralized analytics for end-use applications that touch-sensitive data =E2=80=94 globally!</p><p><br></p><p>We are looking for strong technical foundations in data, distributed computing, and software engineering. We take in feedback daily, but simultaneously filter it through our lenses of privacy and security to output the best user experiences for engineers to build decentralized ML models.</p><p><br></p><p>You will make an impact on the first of its kind Federated Learning platform in a rapidly growing startup.
